Summary Trees
=============

Summary trees generated by SumTrees.

Summarization Information
-------------------------
Trees read from 1 source(s):
- 'Uncarina.concat.res.ufboot.tre'
Total of 1000 trees analyzed for summarization:
- All trees were treated as unweighted
- All trees were treated as rooted
- 23 unique taxa across all trees
- 65 unique splits out of a total of 44000 splits
- 41 unique non-trivial splits counted out of a total of non-trivial 20000 splits
Summarizing onto target tree defined in 'Uncarina.concat.res.treefile':
- Support values expressed as percentages
- Edge lengths as given on target trees
- Support and other summarization annotations added to target trees as metadata
- Target tree(s) rerooted using outgroup: 'I23928 Cet Ceratotheca triloba'
